# PROJECT PLAN TEMPLATE

## Project: TaskMaster Square Brackets Test
Testing the new square bracket format for file paths in plan templates

---

## PHASE 1: Square Bracket Implementation - [COMPLETED]

### Description
Implement and test the new square bracket format for file paths

### Files to Create
- `src/plan-formatter.ts` - New utility for formatting plan files with square brackets
- `tests/bracket-format.test.ts` - Tests to verify square bracket parsing works correctly

---

## PHASE 2: Square Bracket Testing - [IN PROGRESS]

### Description
Test the new square bracket format for file paths in various scenarios

### Files to Create
- [src/bracket-parser.ts] - Parser utility for handling square bracket file format
- [tests/bracket-integration.test.ts] - Integration tests for square bracket functionality
- [docs/bracket-format-guide.md] - Documentation for the new square bracket file format

## TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE

### Phase Status Options
- [PENDING] - Phase is designed but not started
- [IN PROGRESS] - Currently working on this phase  
- [COMPLETED] - Phase is finished and working
- [BLOCKED] - Phase is stopped due to dependencies or issues

### Phase Structure
Each phase should include:
- Clear phase name and current status
- Description explaining phase goals and deliverables
- Complete list of files to create with relative paths
- Detailed explanation of each file's purpose and functionality


### File Path Format
- Use relative paths from project root
- Include file extensions
- Group related files logically
- Describe not just what the file is, but why it exists and how it contributes

### Adding More Phases
Copy the PHASE template above and:
- Number phases sequentially (PHASE 2, PHASE 3, etc.)
- Update phase name to reflect the work being done
- Set appropriate status based on current progress
- List all files that will be created in that phase
- Provide detailed descriptions for each file's role

## NOTES
Additional project notes, decisions, or important considerations can go here. 

### Reasoning Template
Include your technical reasoning and approach analysis within reasoning tags below each phase:

<reasoning>
APPROACH ANALYSIS
- Document the considered approaches and their trade-offs
- Explain architectural decisions and their rationale
- List potential challenges and mitigation strategies
- Detail performance considerations
- Outline security implications
- Document scalability factors

TECHNOLOGY CHOICES
- Justify selected technologies and frameworks
- Explain why alternatives were not chosen
- Document version constraints and compatibility requirements

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
- Break down complex features into manageable components
- Outline data flow and state management approaches
- Document API design decisions and patterns
- Detail error handling and validation strategies

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
- Note potential future scaling requirements
- Document technical debt decisions
- List planned optimizations and improvements
</reasoning>

The reasoning section should be updated throughout the project lifecycle as new insights and decisions are made. Each phase may include its own reasoning block to document phase-specific technical decisions and approaches.
