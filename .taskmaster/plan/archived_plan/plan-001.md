# PROJECT PLAN TEMPLATE

## Project: TaskMaster MCP Server Enhanced
Enhanced Model Context Protocol server with comprehensive plan management, memory storage, and document management capabilities.

---

## PHASE 1: Plan Management System - [COMPLETED]

### Description
Implement enhanced plan management with new directory structure and detailed status reporting

### Files to Create
- `src/index.ts` - Enhanced MCP tools with detailed plan status feedback
- `src/utils.ts` - Updated utility functions for new plan directory structure

---

## PHASE 2: Testing & Validation - [COMPLETED]

### Description
Test the enhanced plan management system and validate all functionality

### Files to Create
- `tests/plan-management.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests for plan management functionality

---

## PHASE 3: Documentation & Deployment - [COMPLETED]

### Description
Create comprehensive documentation and deploy the enhanced plan management system

### Files to Create
- `.taskmaster/docs/plan-management-guide.md` - Complete guide for using the enhanced plan management tools
- `.taskmaster/docs/api-reference.md` - Updated API reference with new plan management functionality

---

## PHASE 4: Final Testing - [IN PROGRESS]

### Description
Comprehensive testing of all enhanced plan management features with real-world scenarios

### Files to Create
- `tests/integration-tests.ts` - Integration tests for complete plan management workflow
- `tests/edge-cases.ts` - Test edge cases and error conditions in plan management

---

## PHASE 5: Release & Archival - [PENDING]

### Description
Complete the project by finalizing all components and archiving the successful plan

### Files to Create
- `.taskmaster/docs/release-notes.md` - Comprehensive release notes documenting all new features and improvements
- `.taskmaster/docs/migration-guide.md` - Guide for migrating from old plan.md structure to new plan management system

---

## TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE

### Phase Status Options
- [PENDING] - Phase is designed but not started
- [IN PROGRESS] - Currently working on this phase  
- [COMPLETED] - Phase is finished and working
- [BLOCKED] - Phase is stopped due to dependencies or issues

### Phase Structure
Each phase should include:
- Clear phase name and current status
- Description explaining phase goals and deliverables
- Complete list of files to create with relative paths
- Detailed explanation of each file's purpose and functionality


### File Path Format
- Use relative paths from project root
- Include file extensions
- Group related files logically
- Describe not just what the file is, but why it exists and how it contributes

### Adding More Phases
Copy the PHASE template above and:
- Number phases sequentially (PHASE 2, PHASE 3, etc.)
- Update phase name to reflect the work being done
- Set appropriate status based on current progress
- List all files that will be created in that phase
- Provide detailed descriptions for each file's role

---

## NOTES
Additional project notes, decisions, or important considerations can go here. 

### Reasoning Template
Include your technical reasoning and approach analysis within reasoning tags below each phase:

<reasoning>
APPROACH ANALYSIS
- Document the considered approaches and their trade-offs
- Explain architectural decisions and their rationale
- List potential challenges and mitigation strategies
- Detail performance considerations
- Outline security implications
- Document scalability factors

TECHNOLOGY CHOICES
- Justify selected technologies and frameworks
- Explain why alternatives were not chosen
- Document version constraints and compatibility requirements

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
- Break down complex features into manageable components
- Outline data flow and state management approaches
- Document API design decisions and patterns
- Detail error handling and validation strategies

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
- Note potential future scaling requirements
- Document technical debt decisions
- List planned optimizations and improvements
</reasoning>

The reasoning section should be updated throughout the project lifecycle as new insights and decisions are made. Each phase may include its own reasoning block to document phase-specific technical decisions and approaches.
